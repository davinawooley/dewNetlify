In addition, successful trainers emphasized understanding dog body language and structuring \n personalized training regimens.\n <br> <br>\n</p>\n</div>\n<div id=\"tabbed\">\n<h1>Unsuccessful Amateur</h1>\n<!-- Unsuccessful Amateur<br><br> -->\n<p id=\"bioBody\"> \nFrom our interviews with dog owners who were not successful in training their dogs, we gathered that many of them could not tell why their dog \nwas doing what it was doing. <br><br> Or if their actions had any direct impact on the dog. <br><br> They also expressed that during training, \nthey were uncertain as to whether the dog was learning or if their feedback was effective. <br><br> The owners did not have an accurate \nrepresentation of the dog’s behaviors and could not accurately map those behaviors to emotional states. Because of this, the owners believed that\n their work was in vain deterred them from future training efforts. <br><br>\n </p>\n</div>\n<div id=\"tabbed\">\n <h1>Experienced Professional</h1>\n<!-- Experienced Professional<br><br> -->\n<p id=\"bioBody\"> \nMore experienced dog trainers mentioned that this fundamental misunderstanding of canine body language can lead to high distress for both the dog\n and the trainer. <br><br> This finding is important to note so that we can include common dog behaviors and stressors for trainers to avoid \n implementing.\n<br><br>Dog owners who struggled with training expressed that their dogs would behave well when in low-stimulus environments but would appear \nto ignore or forget their training in high-stimulus environments. This finding is important for our deliverable so that we can implement a way to\ncheck environmental controls.\n</p>\n</div>\n\n<h1 id=\"sectionHead\">Conclusion</h1>\n<p id=\"bioBody\"> \n    • Effective dog training fundamentally relies on effective communication and consistency.\n<br><br>• Struggling dog trainers should first identify what\n motivates their dog (treats, toys, affection, etc.) and understanding a dog’s body language.\n\n <br><br>• Dog behavior is predictable based on the stimuli offered and the motivating goal or reward.\n\n</p>\n\n\n<h1 id=\"sectionHead\">Prototype Implementation</h1>\n<p id=\"bioBody\">\n“Dognitive Science”, is a mobile application prototype that created using Adobe Illustrator and Adobe XD. All design\n  decisions were influenced by key insights obtained from our interviews.\n\n</p>\n\n<h1 id=\"sectionHead\">Validation Plan</h1>\n<p id=\"bioBody\">\nWe recruited dog owners that were not professional dog trainers to test our prototype.\n<br><br>We conducted cognitive walkthroughs with each participant to identify design weaknesses and to determine whether or not the app is usable.\nThe task will require users to teach the dog to learn how to sit. Mainly, we want to see if the user can glean useful information from the training tool. \n<br><br>At the end of the test, we will ask the participant the following questions:\n\n<br><br><b>Based on initial test, we were able to:</b><br>\n1) improve upon the usability and design of our app\n<br>2) understand if the tool is working as intended.\n</p><h1 id=\"sectionHead\">High-Fidelity Prototype</h1>\n    </div>\n    </div>\n    <p></p>\n    \n\n<iframe width=\"375\" height=\"667\" src=\"https://xd.adobe.com/embed/261f6eeb-39b6-4852-89e8-693d9c0a73fa-734c/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n\n<style>#myBtn {\n      display: none;\n      position: fixed;\n      bottom: 30px;\n      right: 30px;\n      z-index: 99;\n      border: none;\n      outline: none;\n      cursor: pointer;\n      padding: 15px;\n    }</style>\n\n\n<button onclick=\"topFunction()\" id=\"myBtn\" title=\"Scroll to Top\" class=\"back-to-top-link\"><img src=\"/831f353ed06b4cfc74b7ab66c569e371.png\" width=\"30px\"></button>\n  \n<!-- </div> -->\n\n<script>var mybutton = document.getElementById(\"myBtn\");\n\nwindow.onscroll = function () {\n  scrollFunction();\n};\n\nfunction scrollFunction() {\n  if (document.body.scrollTop > 750 || document.documentElement.scrollTop > 750) {\n    mybutton.style.display = \"block\";\n  } else {\n    mybutton.style.display = \"none\";\n  }\n}\n\nfunction topFunction() {\n  document.body.scrollTop = 0;\n  document.documentElement.scrollTop = 0;\n}</script>\n\n    </div>\n    \n    <div id=\"footer\">\n        <span title=\"Navigate to Behance\">\n            <a class=\"bottom\" href=\"https://www.behance.net/davinawooley\" target=\"_blank\" onmouseover=\"this.bgColor='white'; this.style.color='#a1a1a1'\" onmouseout=\"this.bgColor='#a1a1a1'; this.style.color='rgb(74, 74, 74)'\">Behance</a>\n           </span>\n            <div id=\"hyphen\">|</div>\n            <span title=\"Navigate to LinkedIn\">\n            <a class=\"bottom\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/davinawooley/\" target=\"_blank\" onmouseover=\"this.bgColor='white'; this.style.color='#a1a1a1'\" onmouseout=\"this.bgColor='#a1a1a1'; this.style.color='rgb(74, 74, 74)'\">LinkedIn</a></span>\n            <div id=\"hyphen\">|</div>\n            <span title=\"Navigate to GitHub\">\n            <a class=\"bottom\" href=\"https://github.com/davinawooley\" target=\"_blank\" onmouseover=\"this.bgColor='white'; this.style.color='#a1a1a1'\" onmouseout=\"this.bgColor='#a1a1a1'; this.style.color='rgb(74, 74, 74)'\">GitHub</a></span>\n            <h6> © 2022 Davina Wooley.</h6>\n    </div>\n\n</body>\n</html>"},"sourceMaps":null,"error":null,"hash":"99ff81a0fed79469da64f52e02d2ade6","cacheData":{"env":{}}}
